yeomanAngularApp
================
The purpose of this project is to show the changes I make to projects created by the Yeoman angular-generator.

This base of this project was created by executing: 
```javascript
yo angular


     _-----_
    |       |    .--------------------------.
    |--(o)--|    |    Welcome to Yeoman,    |
   `---------´   |   ladies and gentlemen!  |
    ( _´U`_ )    '--------------------------'
    /___A___\
